Bootstrap aggregating, also called bagging (from bootstrap aggregating), is a 
machine learning ensemble meta-algorithm designed to improve the stability and accuracy of 
machine learning algorithms used in statistical classification and regression. It also reduces 
variance and helps to avoid overfitting
